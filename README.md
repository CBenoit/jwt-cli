# jwt-cli

A super fast CLI tool to decode and encode JWTs built in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).

# Installation

As of right now, the only way to get jwt-cli on your system is by downloading the binary. You can do that from the [release](https://github.com/mike-engel/jwt-cli/releases) page. Eventually I might publish to homebrew and other OS package managers.

Only 64bit linux, macOS, and Windows targets are pre-built. Sorry if you're not on one of those! You'll need to build it from the source. See the [contributing](#contributing) section on how to install and build the project.

# Usage

For usage info, use the `help` command.

```sh
# top level help
jwt-cli help

# command specific help
jwt-cli help generate
```

# Contributing

I welcome all issues and pull requests! This is my first project in rust, so this project almost certainly could be better written. All I ask is that you follow the [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md) and use [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt) to have a consistent project code style.

To get started you'll need `rustc` and `cargo` on your system. If they aren't already installed, I recommend [rustup](https://rustup.rs) to get both!

## Running and building the project

Once you have both installed you'll want to install the dependencies.

```sh
# install dependencies via cargo
cargo update
```

After that, I recommend running the tests and doing a debug build to make sure all is well from the start.

```sh
# run the tests
cargo test

# run a debug build
cargo build

# or, if you want, a release build
cargo build --release
```

If it built successfully, you should be able to run the command from the `target` folder.

```sh
# on macOS/linux
./target/debug/jwt-cli help

# on windows
target\debug\jwt-cli help
```
